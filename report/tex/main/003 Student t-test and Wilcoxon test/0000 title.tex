\section{Student t-test and Wilcoxon test}

In the tables, both Student t-test and Wilcoxon test p-values are reported. Only the Wilcoxon test p-values will be analyzed. Only the relative percentage deviation has been tested.

Depending on the instances compared, IIRFE, IISBI, IISFE, IISFI are often considered probably similar to the VND approaches.

VND approaches are considered probably relatively close to each other (depending on instance sizes).
