\section{Running time optimizations}

\subsection{Delta evaluation}

Only the difference between the neighbour and the current solution is evaluated.

\subsection{Cache locality}

For jobs $\times$ machines matrices, a single array is allocated. Row \verb!i! column \verb!j! is accessed through \verb![i*w+j]! subscripting where \verb!w! is the number of columns. The evaluations functions try to read and write data sequentially.

\subsection{Remarks on neighborhood ordering}

For the first improvement pivoting approach, the neighborhood ordering seems to have a significant influence. Perturbations close to the end of the schedule have little influence on the solution quality and evaluates rapidly whereas perturbations close to the beginning of the schedule have a high influence on the solution quality and evaluates slowly. For this implementation quality solution has been emphasized and neighborhood walking techniques have been chosen accordingly.
