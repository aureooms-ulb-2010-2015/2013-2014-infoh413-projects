\subsection{Average relative percentage deviation from the best known solutions}

\subsubsection{Init}

When used with \verb!--neighborhood transpose!, slack heuristic gives always better results than randomn permutation. For other neighborhoods, results are mitigated.

\subsubsection{Pivoting}

The first improvement approach seems to give globally better results.

\subsubsection{Neighborhood}

The transpose neighborhood is the least scoring one for all instances and results vary greatly depending on the initial generated solution (combination with slack heuristic giving a better final result than randomn permutation). This can be explained by the fact that the transpose neighborhood is too local.

The insert neighborhood seems to be the best candidate in terms of solution quality.

The exchange neighborhood lies not too far from the insert neighborhood with a reasonable relative percentage deviation.



\subsubsection{Remarks}

IIRFI and IISFI are the best algorithms for all instances.
