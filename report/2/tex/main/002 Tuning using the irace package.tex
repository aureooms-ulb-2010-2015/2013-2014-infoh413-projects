\section{Tuning algorithm parameters using the irace package}
\label{tune}

In order to determine relatively good parameters for both algorithms the irace package was used.
Each algorithm was trained on all $50 \times 20$ instances with the termination criterion used for the QRD experiments.

The output of the automatic tuning is reported in \ref{app:tuning}.
