\subsection{Tabu Search algorithm}
\label{impl:tabu}

\subsubsection{Outline}

This algorithm is a simple SLS method adpated from the \emph{TABU} algorithm found in \cite{santostabu}.

The outline of the algorithm can be seen in \ref{app:alg:tabu}.

The \emph{TABU} vector keeps track of recently moved job so that the relative order of jobs can preserved for some time $t$.

\subsubsection{Initial solution}

The \emph{NEH} construction heuristic used in \cite{santostabu} has not been used. Instead the two options of implementation exercise 1 are available : slack heuristic or random permutation.


\subsubsection{Termination criterion}

The termination criterion can be specified eiter by a maximum number of steps or a maximum amount of computation time.


\subsubsection{Other parameters}

The sample size factors $r_{min}, r_{max}$, the tabu tenure factors $t_{min}, t_{max}, t_{2nd}$, the restart threshold $\mathcal{R}$ and the neighborhood are left as parameters for the user of the program (\emph{insert} is the one used in \cite{santostabu}).
