\section{Implementation}

\nb{Both algorithms have been designed in order to reuse most of the work done for the first implementation exercise.}

\nb{The majority of the numerical parameters are expressed in terms of a function of eiter the instance size of the neighborhood size to allow a better scaling of the parameter set with the instance size.}
