\subsection{Computer spec}

\begin{tabular}{rl}
mem, proc, os & ULB hydra cluster (see {\small\url{https://cc.ulb.ac.be/hpc/hydra_specs.php}})\\
compiler & g++ 4.8.2 with -O3 flag\\
\end{tabular}

I understand running tests on a cluster will not produce accurate results. However, I choose to do so because my computer isn't powerful enough to run all tests within the deadline.
