This work presents an implementation, statistical studies and run-time distribution of two SLS algorithms for the permutation flow-shop scheduling problem (PFSP) with weighted tardiness objective.
The first algorithm is an iterated greedy algorithm adapted from \cite{DBLP:journals/eor/RuizS08}.
The second algorithm is a tabu search algorithm adapted from \cite{santostabu}.
