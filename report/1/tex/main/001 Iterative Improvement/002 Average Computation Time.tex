\subsection{Average computation time}


\subsubsection{Init}

Except for the transpose neighborhood for which runs are too short, for the same combination of other parameters the slack heuristic produces faster runs than a random permutation.

\subsubsection{Pivoting}

The best improvement approach seems to give globally faster runs.

\subsubsection{Neighborhood}

The transpose neighborhood gives the fastest runs for all instances and all combinations of other parameters.

For the same combination of other parameters the insert neighborhood runs slower than the exchange neighborhood.


\subsubsection{Remarks}

IIRFE and IIRFI are (in order) the slowest algorithms for all instances.
